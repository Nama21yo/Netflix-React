## Netflix Clone

The Netflix Clone is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionalities of a video streaming platform. This project demonstrates my expertise in building feature-rich applications that integrate third-party APIs for dynamic content.

### Features
- **Frontend Development**: The frontend is built using React, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface. Vite is used as the build tool to ensure fast development and optimized performance.
- **Authentication**: User authentication and account management are implemented using Firebase for secure and seamless access.
- **Backend Development**: Node.js and Express.js are utilized to handle server-side logic, including API requests and data processing.
- **Content Integration**: The application integrates with **The Movie Database (TMDb) API** to fetch and display real-time movie and TV show data, including titles, genres, ratings, and poster images.
- **Deployment**: The application is deployed on Netlify for fast and reliable hosting.
